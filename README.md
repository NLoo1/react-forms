# React Forms

Two part project focusing on forms in React.

## Part 1: Color Box Maker
Takes user input that specifies a box's width, height, and background color. When submitted via NewBoxForm, a new Box component is created and added to BoxList and displayed on App.
- When testing, run `npm test -- -u` to account for dynamic snapshots.

## Part 2: To-do App
Simple to-do list that allows users to see, add, edit, and remove to-do tasks. There is a NewTodoForm to add new tasks, a Todo component for each task, TodoList for the entire list, and App to render everything.
